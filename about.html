          During my JEE preparation, i lost track of myself and my capacbilities and got highly demotivated because of the coaching classes culture where only some selected students were nurtured and the rest were left on their own. But it never stopped me from trying, I got hold of myself and 
         and got back on path, earning admission in a reputed college.
